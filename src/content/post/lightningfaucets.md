A common misconception is that one has to be technical to get involved with lightning projects, this is absolutely not true! This morning,DarthCoin ₿⚡️ and I were discussing how to get more plebs involved in the space.

## How to contribute? I can’t write code.

Can’t write code? No worries! There’s a lot of value one can add by just being willing to have an open mind and trying new things such as:

- Testing new apps, features and giving feedback to developers.
- Helping proof read and improve documentation.
- Helping with Translations. Very important for global adoption!
- Sharing your experiences and teaching others how to use apps by giving a workshop.

## Not sure where to get started? No problem.

We’ll list some example lightning projects here, but it can apply to nearly any other open source bitcoin project in the space.

- Most projects have a documentation section or wiki on github.com. And many also have chatrooms as well!

  - [LNBits](https://lnbits.com) has an ever growing Docs wiki, Github and Chatroom
  - [Blixt wallet](https://github.com/hsjoberg/blixt-wallet): Docs, Github, Chatroom
  - [Zeus wallet](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus): Docs, Github, Chatroom

- Talk to other users and developers on the projects chatroom. Asking questions is ok, just be willing to try, it will be rewarding! Don’t be discouraged if things don’t work out the first time you try, it happens to all of us. Just describe your experience and perhaps someone else has encountered the same issue before.

- Go to your local Bitcoin meetup and ask. Or online, for example at Plebnet. (What’s Plebnet?
  [Read this](https://plebnet.wiki/wiki/Welcome_to_Plebnet) to find out more.)

- Create an account for yourself on github.com and check out the [non-technical guide](https://ben.balter.com/2023/03/02/github-for-non-technical-roles/) for github users. OMG Github is used by non-technical folks?! Yes I know, a shocker, but true.

If you find a bug, you can help developers by [creating an issue](https://www.7pace.com/blog/github-issues).

What’s an issue?

“GitHub Issues allows you to create text-based descriptions of tasks, bugs, changes, and updates in your software development project to keep track of them and address them systematically.”

Or create a [pull request](https://www.howtogeek.com/devops/what-are-git-pull-requests-and-how-do-you-use-them/) to help edit documentation or add a new translation! Are you a language and grammar guru? Find a typo or spelling error in the docs? Find something that could be explained better or clarified? Want to fix it? Make a Pull request!

## Don’t have sats for testing? No worries.

Lightning Faucets are a great way to get sats for testing. Here are a couple places to get some sats so that you can use for testing out apps in development. Some are completely free, others come as bonuses for using a service.

- [Sats Faucet](https://satsfaucet.com/register?r=1184)
- [Bitcoin Lighting Faucet](https://www.lightningnetworkstores.com/faucet)
- [21 Days of Bitcoin, Learn and Earn](https://www.lightningnetworkstores.com/faucet)
- [Foldapp.com](https://foldapp.com/) (get 50,000 sats when you sign up for their card, KYC required)
- [The Bitcoin Company](https://foldapp.com/) (get 1000 sats with this link, Referral CODE: P9R8Z8, no KYC)

## Get Rewarded

And before you know it, you’ll be the lightning app guru amongst your friends! Voila!

If that wasn’t enough……An extra perk for being an open source contributor is the opportunity to get a Bitcoin Conference ticket while helping out one of the many projects listed [here](https://b.tc/conference/opensource). It’s open to everyone, even kids! One of youngest contributors to this program is just 15 Years old!

“Our greatest asset as bitcoiners is the blossoming open source community that makes this movement possible.”

All three of the projects mentioned in this blog post (LNBits, Zeus and Blixt) qualify for the Open source ticket program, so get your Pull requests in today!

Stay Reckless and have fun doing it! Who knows what new worlds you might explore next!
