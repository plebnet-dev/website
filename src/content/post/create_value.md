## Instead of Seeking Value, Focus on Creating It

....advice asked, advice delivered

People often ask, “How can I find this opportunity or job in …. industry? or I’m looking for this…. where can I find it? How do it get it?”

Here’s what I think:

> How about shifting that mindset around? 

Instead, how about focusing on producing, creating or making it? Maybe make it a hobby project or a blog post or creative content that is related to what you’re seeking.

This mindset drives the value energy towards you.

And you don’t have to be an expert. You can start creating today. Every little bit is a step in the right direction. Contribute to your community, tell your friends and close ones to amplify your intention.

And then something funny happens. Suddenly, people start approaching you as “Subject Matter Expert” or asking you for advice, potentially offering you work.

Use your inner power to create instead of chasing it!
