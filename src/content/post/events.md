## Event: Nostr Q and A

Date: Dec 19, 2023, 6:00 PM PST

This is a Members Only Event.

Description: Nostr Q and A

Nostr is more than social media. It's a censorship-resistant communications protocol that has the potential to change the Internet and maybe even the way we organize society.  I use it to write my blog. organize a meetup, create bitcoin monthly subscriptions and shop in the bitcoin circular economy and a whole lot more.

Join me to learn how to get onboard, ask me anything about it, and hang out.

## Workshop: Building Apps with LNBits

Date: Jan 21, 2023, 2:00 PM PST

This is a 1 hr members only workshop.

Bitkarrot will walk through how to get started in development with LNBits as someone new to the lightning network. We will cover the lightning resources that Plebnet.dev currently provides. If time permits, we'll also cover the mechanics of how to build LNBits extensions. (If not, we'll make a separate workshop, pending demand)

ðŸš©Pre-requisite: An understanding and ability to write web apps and use web APIs. Knowledge of python and/or javascript is not required but is a plus as much of the workshop will be digging into code in these languages.

What is LNBits? A Free Open-Source Bitcoin Lightning Accounts System with Extensions . See more at https://lnbits.com/
